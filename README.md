# Image Classification Using CNN

## Project Overview
This project implements **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to perform image classification. CNNs are widely used for computer vision tasks, and this project is designed to help beginners understand the key concepts of deep learning and image classification.

## Key Objectives
- Build and train a CNN model for image classification.
- Preprocess image data to make it suitable for training the model.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy.
- Visualize training history, including loss and accuracy curves.

## Techniques Used
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Used for feature extraction and image classification.
- **Keras & TensorFlow**: Libraries used to build and train the model.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like flipping, rotating, and zooming to improve model generalization.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resizing, scaling, and normalizing image data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and training curves to assess model performance.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled images used for training and testing the model.
- Each image belongs to a predefined class, and the model learns to classify these images based on the patterns it detects during training.

## Requirements
To run the project, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running `.ipynb` files)

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
